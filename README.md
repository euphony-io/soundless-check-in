This is a check-in application that identifies visitors, especially effective during the COVID-19.

Using this application, you can check in with sound wave communication instead of QR code.

When the check-in is complete, visitor and store information are stored in the database, along with the check-in time. 

## Reason for making this application

The existing 'QR code check-in'  has the following problems.

* If the lens of the device receiving the data is dirty, it is not recognized well.
* If the surroundings are too bright or too dark, it is not recognized well.
* The process of accessing QR codes is complicated, especially for the elderly.

Because this application is user-friendly and use sound-communication,  there is no inconvenience like above !
